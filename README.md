# DLSS In 3 Weekends

## Background

Real time raytracing has become a killer feature of many AAA game releases. With the advancement in deep-learning architectures, there has been a push to use machine learning to help accelerate the raytracing process in a variety of methods from sample prediction to image space denoising. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is to perform ray-tracing at a low resolution
