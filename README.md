# DLSS In 3 Weekends

## Background

Real time raytracing has become a killer feature of many AAA game releases. With the advancement in deep-learning architectures, there has been a push to use machine learning to help accelerate the raytracing process in a variety of methods from sample prediction to image space denoising. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is to perform ray-tracing at a low resolution and low sample count, apply some learned upsampling technique to reach the desired resolution, and then apply a denoising filter to clean up the noise from the stochastic samples.

This is the approach essentially touted by Nvidia's DLSS system (CITATION HERE). For this project we seek to create a system that can perform
